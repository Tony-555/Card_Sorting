# WCST_JSPsych

A card sorting task created with JSPsych, based on the Berg's Card Sorting Task <a src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063885">(Fox et al., 2013).</a> 

<h1>Structure of the task</h1>
In the task, four cards appear on the screen. Each card has a different color, number, and shape property. From left to right: 1 red triangle, 2 green star, 3 yellow diamond, and 4 blue circle.
Below the four cards, a fifth one appears on the screen. The task is to classify the fifth card to one of the upper cards. The classification can be done based on the color, number, or shape property. The user can classify the new card by cliking on one of the four cards.
The correct answer depends on a rule (color, number, or shape). The rule is not known by the user. However, a feedback is given to the user after each clicks (Correct or Wrong).
